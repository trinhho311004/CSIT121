					<a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/">1. Webtoon</a>
					<p>&emsp;Webtoon is a type of digital comic or graphic novel that originated in South Korea and is now popular all over the world. Unlike traditional comics that are printed on paper, webtoons are published online and optimized for reading on mobile devices. Webtoons often have a vertical scrolling format, with each episode or chapter consisting of one long vertical strip of panels that can be easily read by scrolling down the screen. They can cover a wide range of genres, including romance, action, fantasy, comedy, and more.</p>
